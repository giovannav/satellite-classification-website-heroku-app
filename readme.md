#### I crafted this project using Python and Flask to construct a website dedicated to classifying satellite images and identifying suitable areas for community gardens. SQLite served as the database, and the website found was hosted on the Heroku app platform.
#### To achieve the segmentation of satellite images, a neural network with U-Net architecture was trained. This project was done as the culminating project for an integrated course in the eighth semester of my computer engineering major.
